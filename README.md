## Physics engine Charlotte
The objective of this project is to develop a basic Physics Engine that lays on the Position Based Dynamic (PBD) approach and with OPENGL. I am focussing on rendering a Cloth, it depicts easily the efficacity of the PBD method for a Physics Engine.

#### Already implemented:
 - PBD simulation [^1]
 - Object::Cloth :
     - Constraints: Stretching [DONE]
     - Rigid body collision [IN PROGRESS]
     - bending force [IN PROGRESS]
  - Object::Wall :
     - Constraints: None 
  - Object::Cube :
     - Constraints: None
