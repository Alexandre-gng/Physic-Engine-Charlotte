## Physics engine Charlotte
This project is still in progress

The objective is to develop a basic Physics Engine that lay on the Position Based Dynamic (PBD) approach and with OPENGL. I am focussing on rendering a Cloth, it depicts easily the efficacity of the PBD method for a Physics Engine.


#### Already implemented:
 - PBD simulation [^1]
 - Object::Cloth :
     - Constraints: Stretching [DONE], Rigid body collision [IN PROGRESS], bending force [IN PROGRESS]
  - Object::Wall :
     - Constraints: None 
  - Object::Cube :
     - Constraints: None
